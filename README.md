# Unit4
Treehouse Unit 4 Project

This project included creating a database with the peewee Sqlite Module, and then writing to that database with a csv file included with the project. 
I created a menu for the user to select how they would like to interact with the database. With User can add products to the database, View entries within the database, or backup the database into a new csv file. 

Git repo includes the requirements.txt file for modules used in the project.
